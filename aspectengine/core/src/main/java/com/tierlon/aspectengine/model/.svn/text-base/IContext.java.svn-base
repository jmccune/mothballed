/**
 * This represents the context of information.  
 * 
 * In the real world, information is usually shared in contexts-- implicit and explicit.
 * If you and I are in the same culture, speaking the same language, from the same region,
 * we share the same context and therefore understanding about the meaning of certain words,
 * expressions, ideas, etc.  If we do not, a certain amount of misunderstanding can occur
 * as we try to interact. 
 * 
 * In any system where you are trying to generalize relations and information, you will
 * run into the problem of contexts.   This can get quite fuzzy, as in a user asking
 * for "I want the red cars."   Red (255,0,0) as an rgb value is quite precise, but
 * what exactly does "Red" as a word mean to the given user?
 * 
 * Note: This gets interesting.   Length for instance is a single dimension.
 * 								  Length in meters is a dual-context-- a dimension and a unit type.
