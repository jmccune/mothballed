What is the difference between a root element and a context?

A sentence is an element of data derived from the root element.
A sentence may be associated with several contexts-- e.g. for example, it may be used in several documents.  (A talk by a general authority, the bible, a treatise on the sermon on the mount, the topical guide, etc.)




A Particular Sentence may map to:
	[It may be associated with:]
	any of several sources
	any of several comments related to it
	any of several cross references, footnotes, etc.
	any of several highlights related to topical studies
	any of several tags that have been given to it.
	any of several citations that use it
	any of several ratings/reviews that have been given it.
	
	
A Particular Sentence originates from a particular source:
	The source itself may be complex-- just as a verse can belong in a book, a testament, a volume (bible,bom, d&c), or the full set (of standard works)
	The source may be actually several -- A paper written by several joint authors.  [E.g. the document belongs to a paper, but the paper belongs to several authors and the corporation that published it, etc.]
	
	
Each of the above types/ideas (sources, comments, cross-references, highlights, tags, citations, ratings/reviews, etc) is a context.
The context may be simple or complex  (representing one very clear idea and value or representing or connected to several).
