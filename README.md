This project is an independent & personal project to develop a cross-referencing tool kit/application for the purpose of personal study. The original desire and project is part of improved scripture-study, for I can never remember where I saw something (a favorite quote)-- whether that was in the scriptural cannon, a comment heard in discussion, an article read on the web, or a formal talk (e.g. published) given by a church leader, or one of the many books published.

Also as phrases in a particular field (scriptures, doctrinal expressions, etc.) are often repeated, I've often wondered questions, such as "what is the most often quoted scripture?"-- and while one might easily answer John 3:16, the questions become more interesting (what is the most often quoted scripture by X?) where X could be a person, or a particular forum, etc. One could generate a top 10 list, etc.

So this project aspires to allow me to enter in quotes, data-sources, texts etc that I encounter during personal study.

I know of no existing tool that allows this to occur (fully), although I suspect out in the web of things such an application must already exist. However, until I find it and while I have the time, I will make use of the advancement of all these wonderful tools to advance this project.

NOTE: I'm an EMBER amateur and learning this in the process.
