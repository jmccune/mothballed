This package contains the base components -- those that are the base classes
that define the prototypical interface that those types of components should
use.

For example, by looking at the classes in this directory/package, you should
be able to answer the following questions:
	* what methods & properties should a container component define?
	* what are the options (styling, labelling, etc.) available when
	  using a field set?
	* Etc.
